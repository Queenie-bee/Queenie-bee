#### Video Demo: (https://youtu.be/DA1zeSj8w88)
#### Description:
I've always been passionate about text-art and art in general as well. Its amazing what people can create using simple letters and character symobols! This program should help you create this awesome picture made of a few ascii characters in just a few seconds! The way it works is you enter a input file - a jpg, jpeg, and png - and it will generate a black and white text-art version of that photo and save it to a text file.
